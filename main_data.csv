By sunset, special forces and airborne troops were closing in on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians fled imperiled cities, and thousands of Russians protested the decision to go to war. President Vladimir Putin remained defiant as Ukrainians, Russians and observers around the world took stock of the day’s toll. Here are some of the day’s major events:

After a battle in the highly radioactive grounds of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Russian forces seized the power plant where a nuclear reactor melted down in 1986. The condition of the concrete-encased reactor was unknown.

President Biden said new sanctions would target Russia’s elites, top banks and technology exports. He said that the U.S. military would not fight in Ukraine, but that troops would be deployed to NATO’s eastern flank.

At least 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed, officials said, adding that Ukraine had destroyed two Russian helicopters and seven aircraft. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces had destroyed more than 70 military targets, including 11 airfields, a helicopter and four drones.

Thousands of Russians protested the invasion, and hundreds were detained, according to a group that tallies arrests.

2022-02-22 15:40:07,"Brandon Smith, a fourth generation Texas cattle rancher and father of four, was relieved when President Biden signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus package into law nearly a year ago, because it included $4 billion of debt forgiveness for Black farmers. Smith, who owes $200,000 in outstanding loans on his ranch, quickly signed and returned the documents to formally accept the debt relief. He then purchased more equipment for his ranch, believing that he had been given a financial lifeline.

Instead, over a year later, Smith has fallen deeper into debt. He received a notice informing him that the federal government intended to “accelerate” foreclosure on his 46-acre property if he did not start making payments on the loans he believed had been forgiven.

Smith is one of many Black farmers across the nation — a group that has endured decades of discrimination from banks and the federal government — who have yet to see any of President Biden's promised relief because the initiative has been held up by lawsuits from white farmers alleging reverse discrimination.

“I have managed to save some money myself, but it’s far from enough to pay his debts. Plus, I’m here in this country alone, and I want to have some savings. I also fear that if he develops a habit of relying on me, he will stop trying to find a way to earn money or to collect from people who owe him money.

“However, my dad has been trying to solve this situation for some time and has made little progress. It really hurts to see him so sad. I’m worried that if things continue this way for a few years, it will take a toll on his mental and physical health.

The gunman had dropped them during his rampage that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut.

That photo was a “checkmate moment,” Koskoff said, in the novel legal strategy that ultimately resulted in the $73 million settlement last week for the families of nine Sandy Hook victims from insurers for the Remington, the maker of rifle used in the massacre. It was the largest payout so far in a mass-shooting-related case against a gun manufacturer.

2022-02-20 10:55:04,"In 2020 alone, Northwest Texas Hospital in Amarillo, Texas lost 185 nurses — nearly 20% of its nursing staff. In the ICU, that number was closer to 80%. Many of those nurses left to take jobs with travel-nursing agencies, which placed them, on a temporary and highly lucrative basis, in hospitals throughout the country.

Bedside nursing has always been, as one hospital chief executive put it, a ‘‘burnout profession.’’ The work is hard. It is physical and emotional. And hospitals have built shortages into their business model. But when the pandemic hit, shortages only increased, pushing hospitals to the breaking point. Nationwide, the tally of nurses with both the skills and the willingness to endure the punishing routines of Covid nursing — the isolation rooms, the angry families and the unceasing drumbeat of death — is dwindling. In a survey of critical-care nurses last year, 66 percent of respondents said they were considering retirement.

I thought you could be a great fit.” The job she posted listed its selling points — the business had 400 percent growth a year, the backing of a legendary venture capitalist, no limit to personal vacation days, full coverage of employee health-care premiums and the option to work remote or locally.

At least as much energy seemed to be devoted to discussions about improving pay and working conditions. Plans for protests would be made on Antiwork; then, three days later, they could be seen taking place on YouTube. The percentage of employed people who quit their jobs had increased sharply in the summer of 2020, but by the fall the quit rate was higher than it had been in two decades. It kept rising in 2021, and by the end of last summer it reached 3 percent. In May 2021, Anthony Klotz, a professor at Mays Business School, coined a term for this trend: the Great Resignation. In the antiwork subreddit, it seemed that a force was emerging — a community of people, mainly low-wage and blue-collar workers, fed up with their working conditions.

2022-02-16 23:25:04,"It’s true that we’re in the midst of a “quitagion,” given the record number of people (4.5 million) who gave notice in November alone. An estimated 25 million people left their jobs in the second half of 2021. But those top-line numbers obscure a muddier truth. After the latest employment numbers were released in February, they seemed to show remarkable job growth and an unemployment rate of 4 percent. In addition to those workers trying to trade their way into objectively better jobs, millions of others have simply left the work force — because they’re sick, or taking care of children, or retiring, or just plain miserable.

Even among the people who were technically employed, a sizable number were unable to work because of child care issues or sick leave. Add to that the fact that many people who would prefer full-time work with benefits are still working on employers’ terms, which means part-time, unstable employment And if you dig into the quit numbers for higher-wage workers, it’s still hardly about people going on “Eat, Pray, Love” journeys. The full picture just isn’t that rosy, as Noreen Malone writes in the New York Times Magazine.

Many of those nurses left to take jobs with travel-nursing agencies, which placed them, on a temporary and highly lucrative basis, in hospitals throughout the country.

Bedside nursing has always been, as one hospital chief executive put it, a ‘‘burnout profession.’’ The work is hard. It is physical and emotional. And hospitals have built shortages into their business model. But when the pandemic hit, shortages only increased, pushing hospitals to the breaking point. Nationwide, the tally of nurses with both the skills and the willingness to endure the punishing routines of Covid nursing — the isolation rooms, the angry families and the unceasing drumbeat of death — is dwindling. In a survey of critical-care nurses last year, 66 percent of respondents said they were considering retirement.

Last month, Hope asked the Supreme Court to consider setting limits on prolonged isolation under the Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishments.

2021-12-26 10:25:07,"My granddaughter recently moved from her city apartment to our small town. She was having financial problems, and my husband and I decided to buy a small historic hotel in the hope that she could turn it into an artists’ retreat. She had always told us that it was one of her dreams.

In preparation for the move, my granddaughter brought her dog to stay for a week while she and her mother went back to finish packing. My granddaughter bought an Akita puppy during the Covid lockdown, and it became very attached to her. We learned that she had not tried to train or socialize it. We built a special kennel for it because it could not be put in the existing kennel with my daughter’s two dogs; they got into a fight on a previous visit. The first special kennel we built was only four feet tall, and the dog jumped out. So we built a new kennel with six-foot-tall panels. The dog chewed through the wire mesh and escaped. The next day, when my daughter, grandson and granddaughter decided to take all the dogs for a run, the dogs got in a fight. My grandson was bitten while trying to separate them and required medical attention.

Because my granddaughter needed to leave the dog while she and her mother returned home to pack, she decided to board it. The first night, the dog escaped and caused some destruction. Then it escaped again and did more damage. The kennel owner told my granddaughter that someone would have to come and pick up the dog. My husband and I had to drive an hour to get the dog. We constructed a secure pen with a roof so it could not escape. But it did, and then it got trapped in a room in the hotel we bought. It destroyed the curtains, the blinds, the bedding and an air-conditioner, and clawed the door and door frame, before crawling out a second-story window onto a roof and sliding off. The dog wound up at our daughter’s house a block away. I was upset and confronted my granddaughter upon her return. I said I did not want the dog in the house anymore.

My husband has worked with dog breeders. He says it would not be safe to allow the dog to stay, because if it escaped and injured someone, we could be liable. The dog growled at a neighbor who tried to catch it during one of its escapes. There are several Akita rescue groups in the area, and my husband wants my granddaughter to give the dog up. But she won’t, fearful that it might be euthanized.

My granddaughter says she can’t stay without her dog, and her mother says that we are responsible for all of this turmoil because we changed the rules and that we should compromise. My daughter insists that the dog is just very attached to my granddaughter and is not vicious, and says that I just don’t like the dog. It’s true that it has growled at me, and I am afraid of it. What do you think?

My friend was offered the job, but I later learned that she intends to keep the full-time position she currently occupies while signing on for a full-time position at my company. Because each company allows for some remote work, she feels that she’ll be able to balance time for each. This arrangement is clearly against company policy, which requires, among other things, disclosure and approval of all other employment. My friend intends to keep her plans a secret from both companies.

When I made the referral, I had no reason to believe my friend would behave in this manner, and she remains undeterred despite my advice. I’m worried about the potential fallout for her and also that my reputation in the company could be tarnished if her deception comes to light. Now that I’m aware of her plans, should I warn my employer?”
